<h1 align="center">Olympics Data Dive: Unveiling Performance Trends</h1>

### INTRODUCTION<hr>
- The Olympics are a premier international sports event uniting athletes globally, with a rich history dating back to ancient Greece. 
- Data analytics plays a crucial role in understanding and enhancing athletes' performance, training methods, and overall outcomes.
- This project employs Power BI for analyzing Olympic data, providing interactive visualization and advanced statistical modeling.
- The project aims to analyze athlete and country performance across Olympic events, identifying trends and correlations to inform sports management and training strategies.


### OBJECTIVES<hr>
- Explore historical performance trends.
- Study data analytics using tools such as Power BI  
- Develop interactive dashboards for intuitive exploration.
- Utilize Python for statistical analysis and modeling.![image]


### WORKING<hr>
<b>Step 1: Collection of Required Data</b>
- We have utilized our newly constructed dataset ‘Olympics Legacy: 1896-2020’.
- It includes comprehensive data spanning 124 years of Olympics.
- It’s primary file has 12 features and 2,86,238 records.

<b>Step 2: Dashboard Creation using Power BI</b>
- Transform Data: Into a final dataframe by
  - Removing columns
  - Defining relationships / Merging
  - Other measures
   
- Analyzing Olympics data using various charts such as-
  - Table chart: Medal Tally
  - Ribbon chart: Age-wise Performance
  - Pie chart: Gender-wise participation
  - Cards for specific stats

<b>Step 3: Python Analysis</b>
- Performed some strategic analysis in python such as:
  - Merging files on the basis of specific features
  - Extracting summer olympics data
  - Calculating number and names of countries participated
  - Handling missing and duplicate values
  - One Hot Encoding of Medals
  - Grouping encoded data along with original on the basis of specific features
  - Calculating two different medal tallies with respect to accuracy


### RESULTS & VISUALIZATIONS<hr>

### CONCLUSIONS/OUTCOMES<hr>
- Comprehensive Dataset Formation: Through meticulous exploration of 3-4 datasets, we have curated a comprehensive repository of Olympic data spanning various aspects, including athlete performances and other logistical details.

- Insightful Dashboard Creation with Power BI: Utilizing Power BI, we transformed our analytical findings into interactive and visually appealing dashboards, offering stakeholders a user-friendly platform to explore and understand the intricacies of Olympic performance trends.


### FUTURE PLAN<hr>
- Analyze data using Python in detail
- Create a user-friendly interface, like a web app.

### FUTURE SCOPE<hr>
- Analyze data through Tableau.
- Enabling dynamic and up-to-date analysis.
- Enhance predictive modeling capabilities to forecast athlete performances.
